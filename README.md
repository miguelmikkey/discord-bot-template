# Discord bot ðŸ¤– template for DiscordJS bots

This repository contains a basic template for creating Discord bots using `discord.js`, `pm2` for process management, `.env` for environment variable configuration, and MongoDB as the database.

## Features

- [**Discord.js**](https://discord.js.org/): Library to interact with the Discord API.
- [**PM2**](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/): Process manager for Node.js applications, making it easy to run and monitor your bot.
- [**.env**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Environment variable file to securely manage configuration settings.
- [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/): NoSQL database for storing persistent data.
- **Discord notification ErrorHandler**: Sometimes you may encounter errors after deploying your bot; that's why I usually link `error handlers` to a channel in a personal Discord server so I can get notified.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or remote instance) <u>(_Optional_)</u>
- PM2 (install globally using `npm install pm2 -g`)

## Installation

### 1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miguelmikkey/discord-bot-template.git
cd discord-bot-template
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package

```console
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables:

Rename `example.env` to `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your configuration settings:

```.env
# General variables
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Optional variables
ERROR_HANDLER_CHANNEL_ID=your_error_handler_channel_id
GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
```

## Usage

- **Commands:** Customize the bot commands in the commands directory.
- **Events:** Handle Discord events in the events directory.
- **Database:** Use the models directory to define your MongoDB schemas.
- **Error handler channel:** `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` will be notified in your personal `discord-channel`

  ### Test the "whois" default command to check if your bot is alive! :)

  ```console
  node deploy-commands.js
  ```

  Go into any channel where the bot has permissions and type `/whois`, an embed like this should pop up:

## Dependencies
